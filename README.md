# Kodecamp-AWS-VPC-Project
This project was designed to test my understanding of AWS VPC Networking. I will be creating a new Custom VPC network, with 2 subnets (private and public), route tables, security groups, and network access control lists (NACLs) to ensure proper communication and security within the VPC. All this will be created in the AWS EU-West-1 (Ireland) region.

## Project Design 

This is the Architecture diagram of the network I will be creating:
